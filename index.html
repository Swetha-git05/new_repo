    <h1>A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out 
        sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. 
        Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. 
        These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks

     Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, 
     as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design,
     as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones</P>
